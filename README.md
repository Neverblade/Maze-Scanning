# Maze-Scanning
Scans a picture (jpg, png, etc.) of a maze, converts it to computer-readable form, solves, and displays the solved form.

To use, drop images into the images folder, then compile the MazeScanner file and run.

Features:

     Scanning system to convert image to readable form.
     Depth-First Search algorithm for solving.
     Graphics to output the result, with animation.
     
     
What I Learned:

     General process of dealing with images, specifically mazes.
     Utilizing settings to give program greater flexibility/power.
     Systematic bug-fixing approaches (lots of printing to console)
     Rudimentary graphics; how to animate.
     
Needs Work:

     Both image conversion to pixel array and the graphics are done using school-provided code. Need to rewrite.
     Large limitation: program only works on mazes perfectly aligned with the overal image (parallel edges).
     Explanations/definitions for settings/sensitivity options are shaky, needs redefining.
